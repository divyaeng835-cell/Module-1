# Experiment No: 1c-Varibles and Expressions, Operators - evaluate the following expression **a+b*c-a/b**

## AIM
To write a Python program to evaluate the the following expression **a+b*c-a/b**

## ALGORITHM
1. Begin the program.
2. Use the `float()` function to get the three variables as input from the user
3. Apply the input variable to the given expression a+b*c-a/b
4. Print the assigned value of the expression.
5. Terminate the program.

## PROGRAM
```python
a=float(input())
b=float(input())
c=float(input())
d=a+b*c-a/b
print(d)
```
